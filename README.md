# Terminal
My macOS Terminal theme, named "Basic, but sexier".

### Using
Download a ZIP of this repository [here](https://github.com/AppleBetas/Terminal/archive/master.zip), and double click on the file named "Basic, but sexier.terminal". Terminal will open on your Mac with the theme active. To set the theme as your default (the one that new Terminal windows open with, go to Terminal preferences, select the Profiles tab, click on the theme "Basic, but sexier" and click the default button at the bottom of the window. All new Terminal windows will use this theme.
